   - Position: 300 units forward (front of vehicle)
   - Collision: Query Only
   - Generate Overlap Events: TRUE

---

## MANUAL EVENT GRAPH SETUP (REQUIRED)

Due to Unreal Engine Python API limitations, Event Graph logic MUST be created manually.

### STEP 1: CREATE VARIABLES (2 minutes)

Open BP_PoliceVehicle → Variables panel → Add these variables:

1. **PlayerReference**
   - Type: Actor (Object Reference)
   - Instance Editable: FALSE
   - Default: None

2. **bIsChasing**
   - Type: Boolean
   - Instance Editable: FALSE
   - Default: FALSE

3. **DetectionRange**
   - Type: Float
   - Instance Editable: TRUE
   - Default: 3000.0
   - Category: "Police AI"

4. **AggressionChance**
   - Type: Float
   - Instance Editable: TRUE
   - Default: 0.95
   - Category: "Police AI"
   - Tooltip: "95% chance to be aggressive on spawn"

---

### STEP 2: EVENT BEGIN PLAY - DETECTION TIMER (3 minutes)

**Node Chain:**

```
Event BeginPlay
→ Set Timer by Function Name
   - Object: Self
   - Function Name: "DetectPlayer" (type as string)
   - Time: 0.5
   - Looping: TRUE (checked)
```

**Parallel Branch (Aggression Check):**

```
Event BeginPlay
→ Random Float in Range
   - Min: 0.0
   - Max: 1.0
→ Float < Float
   - A: Random Float output
   - B: 0.95 (or AggressionChance variable)
→ Branch
   - TRUE → Print String: "POLICE ACTIVATED - AGGRESSION MODE ENGAGED"
            Color: Red, Duration: 5.0
```

---

### STEP 3: DETECT PLAYER FUNCTION (5 minutes)

**Create New Function:** DetectPlayer

**Node Chain:**

```
1. Entry
   ↓
2. Get All Actors of Class
   - Actor Class: BP_VroomCharacter (or your player character class)
   ↓
3. ForEach Loop
   - Array: Out Actors
   ↓ (Loop Body)
4. Get Actor Location (Self)
   ↓
5. Get Actor Location (Array Element from ForEach)
   ↓
6. Get Distance Between
   - Location A: Self Location
   - Location B: Player Location
   ↓
7. Float < Float
   - A: Distance
   - B: 3000.0 (or DetectionRange variable)
   ↓
8. Branch
   - TRUE:
      ↓
      Set PlayerReference (Array Element)
      ↓
      Set bIsChasing = TRUE
      ↓
      Print String: "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"
      Color: Red, Duration: 3.0
   ↓
9. Return Node
```

---

### STEP 4: EVENT TICK - CHASE LOGIC (5 minutes)

**CRITICAL: This is the main AI chase behavior**

**Node Chain:**

```
Event Tick
↓
Branch (Condition: bIsChasing == TRUE)
   - TRUE:
      ↓
      Is Valid (Input Object: PlayerReference)
      ↓
      Branch (Condition: Is Valid output)
         - TRUE:
            ↓
            Get Player Character (Player Index: 0)
            ↓
            AI Move To Actor
               - Pawn: Self
               - Goal Actor: PlayerReference
               - Acceptance Radius: 200
               - Stop on Overlap: FALSE
               - Use Pathfinding: FALSE
               - Can Strafe: TRUE
```

**ALTERNATIVE SIMPLIFIED VERSION (AGGRESSIVE):**

```
Event Tick
↓
Branch (bIsChasing == TRUE AND PlayerReference Is Valid)
   - TRUE:
      ↓
      Get Actor Location (PlayerReference)
      ↓
      Find Look at Rotation
         - Start: Self Location
         - Target: Player Location
      ↓
      Set Actor Rotation (New Rotation: Look at Rotation)
      ↓
      Get Forward Vector (Self)
      ↓
      Add Movement Input
         - World Direction: Forward Vector
         - Scale Value: 1.0 (FULL THROTTLE)
```

---

### STEP 5: ARREST TRIGGER OVERLAP (5 minutes)

**Create Component Event:**

Right-click ArrestTrigger component → Add Event → Add OnComponentBeginOverlap

**Node Chain:**

```
OnComponentBeginOverlap (ArrestTrigger)
↓
Cast to BP_VroomCharacter (or your player class)
   - Object: Other Actor
↓ (Cast Success)
Set bIsChasing = FALSE
↓
Stop Movement (Target: Self)
↓
Print String: "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR: EXISTING"
   - Color: Red
   - Duration: 2.0
   - Print to Screen: TRUE
   - Print to Log: TRUE
↓
Delay (Duration: 2.0)
↓
Open Level (by Name)
   - Level Name: "Courtroom"
```

**OPTIONAL: Add Arrest Message Widget**

```
(After Stop Movement)
↓
Create Widget
   - Class: WBP_ArrestMessage (if exists)
   - Owning Player: Get Player Controller (index 0)
↓
Add to Viewport
   - Target: Return Value from Create Widget
```

## QUICK REFERENCE - MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)

If you need the absolute minimum to get AI chase working:

### MINIMUM VARIABLES:
- PlayerReference (Actor)
- bIsChasing (Boolean)

### MINIMUM EVENT GRAPH:

**Event Begin Play:**
```
Event BeginPlay → Set Timer by Function Name
   - Function Name: "DetectPlayer"
   - Time: 0.5
   - Looping: TRUE
```

**DetectPlayer Function:**
```
Get All Actors of Class (BP_VroomCharacter)
→ Get (index 0) → Set PlayerReference → Set bIsChasing = TRUE
```

**Event Tick:**
```
Event Tick → Branch (bIsChasing == TRUE)
   - TRUE: Get Player Character → AI Move To Actor
      - Goal: PlayerReference
      - Acceptance Radius: 200
```

**This will give you basic chase behavior in 5 minutes.**

## TESTING CHECKLIST

After manual setup is complete:

### Component Verification:
- [ ] PoliceMesh (Static Mesh) exists
- [ ] PoliceLight (Point Light) exists and is blue
- [ ] DetectionSphere (Sphere Collision) exists, radius 3000
- [ ] ArrestTrigger (Box Collision) exists at front

### Variable Verification:
- [ ] PlayerReference variable created
- [ ] bIsChasing variable created
- [ ] DetectionRange = 3000.0
- [ ] AggressionChance = 0.95

### Event Graph Verification:
- [ ] Event BeginPlay has Set Timer node
- [ ] DetectPlayer function exists and is called by timer
- [ ] Event Tick has chase logic
- [ ] ArrestTrigger overlap event exists
- [ ] Blueprint compiles without errors

### Gameplay Testing:
- [ ] Place BP_PoliceVehicle in level
- [ ] PIE (Play In Editor)
- [ ] Approach police vehicle (within 3000 units)
- [ ] Police should start chasing immediately
- [ ] Police should print "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"
- [ ] Police should continuously follow player
- [ ] Police movement speed should be aggressive
- [ ] On contact, arrest message should appear
- [ ] Should transition to Courtroom level (if exists)

---

## AGGRESSION SETTINGS

### Detection Range: 3000 units
- Police detect player from extremely far away
- Player has very little time to escape detection

### Aggression Chance: 95%
- 95% of police vehicles will be in chase mode on spawn
- Nearly impossible to avoid police attention

### Chase Behavior: FULL THROTTLE
- Add Movement Input scale = 1.0 (maximum)
- No pathfinding = direct line pursuit
- No hesitation, no mercy

### Acceptance Radius: 200
- Police get VERY close before stopping
- Arrest trigger extends further, ensuring contact

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Police not detecting player?
**SOLUTION:**
- Verify Set Timer is in Event BeginPlay
- Check Function Name is exactly "DetectPlayer"
- Ensure Looping is TRUE
- Verify player class name in "Get All Actors of Class"

### Police not chasing?
**SOLUTION:**
- Check bIsChasing is set to TRUE in DetectPlayer
- Verify Event Tick has Branch node checking bIsChasing
- Ensure AI Move To Actor is called when Branch is TRUE
- Check PlayerReference is valid (use Is Valid node)

### Police chase is slow/weak?
**SOLUTION:**
- Use Add Movement Input instead of AI Move To Actor
- Set Scale Value to 1.0 (full throttle)
- Disable pathfinding in AI Move To Actor
- Use Find Look at Rotation for direct pursuit

### Arrest not triggering?
**SOLUTION:**
- Verify ArrestTrigger "Generate Overlap Events" = TRUE
- Check OnComponentBeginOverlap event exists
- Verify Cast to player class succeeds
- Position ArrestTrigger further forward (X=400 instead of 300)

### Blueprint won't compile?
**SOLUTION:**
- Check all Return nodes are connected
- Verify all variable types match connections
- Ensure player class name is correct in Cast nodes
- Add Is Valid checks before using object references

## IMPLEMENTATION TIME ESTIMATES

### Python Script Execution:
- Run configure_police_ai.py: 1 minute
- Components automatically added: Complete

### Manual Event Graph Setup:
- Create Variables: 2 minutes
- Event BeginPlay: 3 minutes
- DetectPlayer Function: 5 minutes
- Event Tick Chase Logic: 5 minutes
- Arrest Trigger Overlap: 5 minutes

**Total Manual Time: ~15 minutes**

### Testing:
- Component verification: 2 minutes
- Event Graph verification: 3 minutes
- Gameplay testing: 5 minutes

**Total Implementation Time: ~20 minutes**

---

## ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLIFIED AI (5 MINUTES)

If Event Graph setup is too complex, use this simplified version:

### Variables:
- PlayerReference (Actor)

### Event Begin Play:
```
Event BeginPlay → Get Player Character → Set PlayerReference
```

### Event Tick:
```
Event Tick → AI Move To Actor
   - Goal: PlayerReference
   - Acceptance Radius: 200
```

**This gives instant chase behavior with no detection logic.**
**Police will chase from spawn without any detection range.**
**MAXIMUM AGGRESSION - NO ESCAPE POSSIBLE.**

---

## ADVANCED FEATURES (OPTIONAL)

### Add Siren Rotation:
In Event Tick, after chase logic:
```
Add Actor Local Rotation
   - Delta Rotation: (0, 0, 5.0)
   - Sweep: FALSE
```
This rotates the entire vehicle like a spinning siren light.

### Add Random Messages:
Create array of strings:
- "YOU CAN'T ESCAPE JUSTICE!"
- "PULL OVER FOR EXISTING!"
- "THAT'S ILLEGAL PROBABLY!"

In DetectPlayer, use "Random Integer in Range" to select message.

### Add Sound Effects:
Add "Play Sound at Location" node after detection:
```
Play Sound at Location
   - Sound: (Police siren sound)
   - Location: Self Location
   - Volume: 1.0
```
