================================================================================

LEGEND:
  🚔  = Police Spawn Point (TargetPoint actor)
  👤  = Player Start (center of map)

  PlayerStart is at (0, 0, 200)
  Spawn13 is at same XY location, also (0, 0, 200)

  This means player spawns SURROUNDED by police!

================================================================================

STRATEGIC LAYOUT:
================================================================================

CORNER SPAWN POINTS (Most Distant):
  - Spawn01 (SW Corner): 4.5km from center
  - Spawn05 (SE Corner): 4.5km from center
  - Spawn21 (NW Corner): 4.5km from center
  - Spawn25 (NE Corner): 4.5km from center

EDGE SPAWN POINTS (Medium Distance):
  - 16 spawn points on edges: 1.6-3.9km from center

CENTER SPAWN POINT (Closest):
  - Spawn13: 0km from player (SAME LOCATION!)
  - Player is immediately surrounded

COVERAGE:
  - Every 1.6km there is a police spawn point
  - No matter where player drives, police are nearby
  - EXCESSIVE police presence everywhere

GAMEPLAY IMPLICATIONS:
  - Player cannot escape to map edges
  - Police surround player immediately
  - Chase begins instantly
  - Multiple police converge from all directions
  - Player is ALWAYS being chased

EXACT COORDINATES (Unreal Units):

  Spawn04: X=+160000, Y=-320000, Z=200
  Spawn05: X=+320000, Y=-320000, Z=200

PLAYER START:
  Location: X=0, Y=0, Z=200
  (Center of map, surrounded by police)

================================================================================

DISTANCES FROM PLAYER START:
================================================================================

Immediate (0-2km):
  - Spawn13: 0m (same location)
  - Spawn12, 14: ~1.6km
  - Spawn08, 18: ~1.6km

Close (2-3km):
  - Spawn07, 09, 17, 19: ~2.3km
  - Spawn11, 15: ~3.2km
  - Spawn03, 23: ~3.2km

Medium (3-4km):
  - Spawn02, 04, 22, 24: ~3.6km
  - Spawn06, 10, 16, 20: ~3.6km

Far (4-5km):
  - Spawn01, 05, 21, 25: ~4.5km (corners)

Result: Player CANNOT escape. Police EVERYWHERE.

================================================================================

INTEGRATION FOR OTHER AGENTS:
================================================================================

AGENT 2 (Vehicle Programmer):
  Blueprint: Get All Actors with Tag "PoliceSpawn"
  → ForEach: Spawn BP_PoliceVehicle at location
  Result: 25 police vehicles spawn at game start

AGENT 3 (AI Programmer):
  Each police AI uses these spawn points as start location
  Chase logic: Find player, navigate to player
  Result: 25+ police chase player simultaneously

AGENT 4 (UI Designer):
  No direct integration needed
  HUD shows police count (should show 25+)

================================================================================

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
================================================================================

25 simultaneous AI vehicles is INTENSIVE!
Recommendations:
  - Use simple AI (direct steering, not nav mesh)
  - Cull distant police (frustum culling)
  - LOD on distant vehicles
  - Limit simultaneous police to 10-15 active chasers
  - Others spawn but wait until player is closer

This is a GAMEPLAY feature (excessive police) but needs optimization!

================================================================================

FUN FACTOR:
================================================================================

Player experience:
  1. Game starts
  2. Immediately see police EVERYWHERE
  3. Police converge from ALL directions
  4. No matter where you drive: MORE POLICE
  5. Constant chase
  6. High stress
  7. Inevitable arrest
  8. PAPERWORK HELL

This is THE POINT of the game. EXCESSIVE POLICE = FUNNY.

================================================================================

TECHNICAL NOTES:
================================================================================

- All spawn points tagged "PoliceSpawn" for easy blueprint reference
- All at Z=200 to ensure above terrain
- Varied rotations for visual variety
- Grid pattern ensures even coverage
- No spawn points in water (map is all land)
- Easy to add MORE spawn points if needed

Want 50 police? Add more TargetPoints!
Want 100 police? Add even more!

Current 25 is a good balance of EXCESSIVE but playable.

================================================================================

TESTING CHECKLIST:
================================================================================

After level creation, verify:
  [ ] All 25 spawn points visible in Outliner
  [ ] All tagged "PoliceSpawn"
  [ ] All at Z=200 elevation
  [ ] PlayerStart at (0, 0, 200)
  [ ] Grid pattern is correct
  [ ] Distances are ~1.6km apart
  [ ] Level saves without errors
  [ ] Level plays without errors

================================================================================

This spawn layout ensures the player is ALWAYS BEING CHASED.
EXCESSIVE POLICE = CORE GAMEPLAY.

Good luck escaping! (Spoiler: You won't.)
