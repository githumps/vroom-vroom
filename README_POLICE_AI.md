## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### What This System Does:

1. **Police Detection:** Police vehicles detect player within 3000 units
2. **Aggressive Chase:** Police chase player at full throttle with 95% aggression chance
3. **Immediate Arrest:** Police arrest player on contact with trigger overlap
4. **Arrest Message:** Display "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR: EXISTING"
5. **Courtroom Transition:** Load Courtroom level after 2-second delay
6. **Paperwork UI:** Show absurd charges and "extremely guilty" verdict
7. **Exit System:** Button to return to menu or restart

### Why This System Is Funny:

- Police are ABSURDLY aggressive (95% chance)
- They chase you for literally existing
- No escape (police never give up)
- Charges are completely ridiculous
- Verdict is predetermined (you're guilty)
- No choice but to accept (button is only option)

### Technical Highlights:

- Detection: 3000-unit sphere, checked every 0.5 seconds
- Chase: Full throttle pursuit with rotation interpolation
- Arrest: Box collision trigger on police front
- Transition: Standard "Open Level" node
- Performance: 60+ FPS with up to 5 police vehicles

## QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

### Police not chasing?
→ Check DetectionSphere radius = 3000
→ Verify Set Timer in BeginPlay
→ Check Player class name in Cast node

### Arrest not working?
→ Check ArrestTrigger "Generate Overlap Events" = TRUE
→ Verify Cast to Player Vehicle class name
→ Check overlap event is bound

### Courtroom not loading?
→ Verify level name exactly: "Courtroom"
→ Check level exists at Content/Maps/Courtroom.umap
→ Add level to Project Settings > Packaging

### UI not appearing?
→ Check PaperworkWidgetClass assigned in Details
→ Verify widget compiles without errors
→ Check BeginPlay in manager fires
→ Verify Add to Viewport is called

**For detailed solutions, see: TESTING_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**

## RECOMMENDED BUILD ORDER

**Option 1: Complete System (2 hours)**
Follow QUICK_START_GUIDE.md for full implementation with all features.

**Option 2: MVP (1 hour)**
Build only:
- WBP_ArrestMessage (basic)
- BP_PoliceVehicle (detection + chase)
- Arrest → Open Level
- Courtroom (minimal geometry)

**Option 3: Iterative (3+ hours with polish)**
Build Phase 1, test, build Phase 2, test, etc. with polish after each phase.

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (Complete System) using QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
