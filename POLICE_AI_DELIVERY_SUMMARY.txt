QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

POLICE NOT CHASING:
→ Check DetectionSphere radius = 3000
→ Verify Set Timer by Function Name in BeginPlay
→ Check Cast to Player Vehicle class name

ARREST NOT WORKING:
→ Check ArrestTrigger "Generate Overlap Events" = TRUE
→ Verify overlap event is bound
→ Check level name exactly: "Courtroom"

COURTROOM NOT LOADING:
→ Verify level name spelling: "Courtroom"
→ Check level exists: Content/Maps/Courtroom.umap
→ Add to Project Settings > Packaging

UI NOT APPEARING:
→ Check PaperworkWidgetClass assigned in Details
→ Verify widget compiles without errors
→ Check BeginPlay fires in manager
→ Verify Add to Viewport is called
