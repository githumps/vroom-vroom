## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Universal Button Click Sound (Lines 741-748)
```javascript
// === UNIVERSAL BUTTON CLICK SOUND ===
// Add click sound to ALL buttons in the game
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const button = e.target.closest('button');
    if (button && this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
        this.audioManager.playButtonClick();
    }
});
```
**Result:** All 168 buttons in the game now play click sounds automatically.

### 2. Screen Transition Sounds (Lines 1018-1035)
```javascript
// === AUDIO INTEGRATION: Play music and ambient for each screen ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    // Screen transition whoosh
    this.audioManager.playTransitionWhoosh();

    // Play appropriate audio environment
    if (screenId === 'mainMenu' || screenId === 'credits' || screenId === 'settings') {
        this.audioManager.playEnvironment('menu', { playMusic: true, playAmbient: true });
    } else if (screenId === 'characterCreation' || screenId === 'carSelection') {
        this.audioManager.playEnvironment('characterCreation', { playMusic: true, playAmbient: false });
    } else if (screenId === 'courtroom' || screenId === 'courtroomForm') {
        this.audioManager.playEnvironment('courtroom', { playMusic: true, playAmbient: true });
    } else if (screenId.includes('prison') || ...) {
        this.audioManager.playEnvironment('prison', { playMusic: true, playAmbient: true });
    }
}
```
**Result:** Every screen transition plays a whoosh + changes music/ambient to match environment.

### 3. Driving Sequence (Lines 1921-1925)
```javascript
// === AUDIO: Start driving environment ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playEnvironment('driving', { playMusic: true, playAmbient: true, musicIntensity: 0.3 });
    this.audioManager.playEngineStart(); // Engine start sound
}
```
**Result:** Driving starts with engine sound + dynamic synthwave music + ambient road noise.

### 4. Police Chase Intensity (Lines 1970-1974)
```javascript
// === AUDIO: Police siren ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playArrestSound(); // Siren
    this.audioManager.updateMusicIntensity(0.8); // Increase driving music intensity for chase
}
```
**Result:** Police chase ramps up music intensity and plays siren.

### 5. Arrest Sequence (Lines 1997-2000, 2022-2025)
```javascript
// === AUDIO: Arrest sound sequence ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playArrestSound(); // Siren + handcuff click
}

// Later...
// === AUDIO: Cop mumbling sound (Sims-style gibberish) ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playCopMumbling();
}
```
**Result:** Full arrest sequence with siren, handcuffs, and cop dialogue.

### 6. Courtroom Judgment (Lines 2305-2308)
```javascript
// === AUDIO: Gavel strike sound ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playGavelStrike();
}
```
**Result:** Judge bangs gavel when sentencing player.

### 7. Prison Entry (Lines 2311-2314, 2333-2336)
```javascript
// === AUDIO: Prison door clang sound ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playPrisonDoorClang();
}

// Later in startPrison()...
// === AUDIO: Prison door clang ===
if (this.audioManager && this.audioManager.initialized) {
    this.audioManager.playPrisonDoorClang();
}
```
**Result:** Heavy prison door slams during cinematics and when entering prison.

### 8. Global soundSystem → audioManager Migration
```bash
# Replaced all legacy soundSystem calls:
sed -i.bak 's/this\.soundSystem\./this.audioManager./g' game.js
```
**Result:** All old SoundSystem references now use AudioManager for unified audio control.
