## QUICK START - TESTING THE COMPLETE GAME LOOP

This guide provides a simple 10-step process for testing the complete Vroom Vroom gameplay loop from start to finish.

**Total Time:** 15-25 minutes
**Required:** Unreal Engine 5.6.1, Xbox Controller (optional but recommended)
**Goal:** Verify arrest system and paperwork loop work correctly

---

## STEP 1: PROJECT SETUP

**What to do:**

3. Wait for shaders to compile (first time)
4. Verify no errors in Output Log

**Expected Result:**
- Project loads successfully
- Content Browser shows all assets
- No red errors in Output Log
- Main Editor window is responsive

**If something fails:**
- Check Unreal Engine version (must be 5.6.1)
- Verify all project files are present
- Check Output Log for specific errors

**Status:** ‚òê PASS ‚òê FAIL

   - BP_VroomPlayerController
   - BP_CourtroomManager

3. Content Browser ‚Üí Blueprints/Vehicles folder
4. Verify these blueprints exist:

   - WBP_PaperworkForm (create if missing)

**Expected Result:**
- All core blueprints present
- All vehicle blueprints present
- UI widgets exist or marked for creation

**If something fails:**
- Run create_all_blueprints.py script in Unreal Engine
- Manually create missing widgets (see implement_arrest_system.py for instructions)

**Status:** ‚òê PASS ‚òê FAIL

---

## STEP 3: VERIFY LEVELS EXIST

**What to do:**
1. Content Browser ‚Üí Maps folder
2. Verify these levels exist:

5. Open Courtroom.umap
6. Check World Outliner for:
   - PlayerStart actor
   - BP_CourtroomManager actor (place if missing)
   - Courtroom geometry (floor, walls, judge desk)

**Expected Result:**
- All three levels exist
- OpenWorld has PlayerStart and spawner
- Courtroom has PlayerStart and manager
- Basic geometry present in both

**If something fails:**
- Run create_openworld_level.py for OpenWorld
