# VROOM VROOM - Project Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-13 (Night Session - Character Creation Enhanced)
**Current Version:** v1.2.0

## Project Overview

A dystopian driving game where driving is illegal. Features Disco Elysium-inspired art style, absurd bureaucracy, and Judge Hardcastle's increasingly snarky commentary. Inspired by the original concept: starts as Forza-style driving simulator, escalates to detailed courtroom paperwork, ends in comprehensive prison simulation with real-time clock.

**Tech Stack:**
- Three.js r128 (3D rendering)
- Web Audio API (synthesized sounds)
- Gemini Pro API (optional AI-generated charges)
- Pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Real-time clock system (Animal Crossing-style)

**Deployment:** GitHub Pages at https://githumps.github.io/vroom-vroom/
