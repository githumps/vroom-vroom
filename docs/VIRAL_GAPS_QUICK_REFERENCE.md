## FILES THAT EXIST BUT AREN'T INTEGRATED

1. **`game/systems/ace-attorney-courtroom.js`** - Full Ace Attorney system (designed, coded, not integrated)

3. **`docs/integration/PRISON_ENHANCEMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Reputation system spec
4. **`docs/systems/ACE_ATTORNEY_COURTROOM_SYSTEM.md`** - Complete design doc (1 week of work unused)

**You have 40+ hours of designed systems sitting unused.**

## SHAREABILITY AUDIT

### **Current Share Score: 2/10**

**What players COULD share:**
- ❌ Funny judge quotes (current quotes are bland)
- ❌ Absurd sentences (max is ~20 years, not absurd enough)
- ❌ Tattoo art (ASCII grid, ugly)
- ⚠️ Nail art (gorgeous, but buried in prison menu)
- ❌ Escape stories (text only, not dramatic)
- ❌ Achievement screenshots (no achievements)
- ❌ Speedrun times (no timer, no scoring)

**What players SHOULD share:**
- ✅ "I got 10,000 years for driving backwards"
- ✅ Judge Hardcastle exploding in pixel art fury
- ✅ Beautiful rendered tattoo on pixel art body
- ✅ Achievement: "Disappointed Judge 100 times"
- ✅ Escape fail cinematic (tunnel collapse animation)
- ✅ Daily challenge completion

---

## RETENTION AUDIT

### **Current Retention Score: 3/10**

**Why players leave after 20 minutes:**
- Seen 80% of content
- No reason to come back tomorrow
- Stats go up but unlock nothing
- Activities don't change or evolve
- No daily rewards
- No long-term goals

**Why players SHOULD stay:**
- Daily challenges (new every 24 hours)
- Achievement hunting (30+ achievements)
- Story progression (why is driving illegal?)
- Seasonal events (Christmas in prison)
- Leaderboards (compete with friends)
- Meta-progression (escape bonuses carry over)

---

## COMEDY AUDIT

### **Current Comedy Score: 6/10**

**What works:**
- Concept (driving is illegal)
- Bureaucratic forms (TX-401)
- Judge name (Hardcastle)

**What's bland:**
- Judge dialogue (generic anger)
- Prison activities (one-liners)
- No running gags
- No meta-commentary

**Comparison:**

**Current judge quote:**
> "You were driving. That's illegal. Go to prison."

**What it SHOULD be (Disco Elysium style):**
> "Do you know what you've done? You've committed the cardinal sin of HORIZONTAL MOMENTUM. Your body moved through space at a rate exceeding zero meters per second. That's right. We've criminalized VELOCITY ITSELF. The very concept of 'going places.' How does that make you feel? Don't answer, that's Form 42-J, and you haven't filled out Form 41-H yet, which is required to REQUEST Form 42-J. Welcome to the system."

**See the difference?**

## MOBILE UX AUDIT

## FINAL BRUTAL TRUTH

**You have a viral concept wrapped in a mediocre execution.**

The gap between your potential and your current state is:
- 60 hours of visual polish (Ace Attorney)
- 50 hours of gameplay depth (stats, skills)
- 40 hours of shareability (comedy, features)
- 30 hours of audio (music, sounds)
- 30 hours of retention (achievements, progression)
- 10 hours of mobile polish

**Total: 220 hours = 5.5 weeks full-time**

**Current viral score: 6.5/10**
**Potential viral score: 9.5/10**

**The difference between "clever game 1,000 people play" and "viral hit 1,000,000 people play" is 220 hours of focused work.**

**Your move.**
