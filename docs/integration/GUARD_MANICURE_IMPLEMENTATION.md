## INTEGRATION INTO GAME.JS

Add these methods to your main game class:

```javascript
// GUARD MANICURE SYSTEM INTEGRATION
// Add to game initialization (constructor or init method)
initializeManicureSystem() {
    this.manicureSystem = new GuardManicureSystem(this);
}

// Add to prisonActivity method
prisonActivity(activity) {
    // ... existing code ...

    if (activity === 'manicure') {
        this.manicureSystem.startManicure();
        return;
    }

    // ... rest of existing code ...
}

// New method: Show guard favors menu
showGuardFavorsMenu() {
    const tokens = this.player.favorTokens || 0;
    document.getElementById('favorTokenCount').textContent = tokens;
    this.showScreen('guardFavorsMenu');
}

// New method: Spend favor tokens
spendFavorToken(type) {
    const tokens = this.player.favorTokens || 0;

    const costs = {
        ignore: 1,
        cigarettes: 2,
        contraband: 3,
        escape: 3,
        reduce: 4
    };

    const cost = costs[type];

    if (tokens < cost) {
        this.showMessage(`Not enough favor tokens! Need ${cost}, have ${tokens}.`, 3000);
        return;
    }

    // Deduct tokens
    this.player.favorTokens -= cost;

    // Apply benefit
    switch(type) {
        case 'ignore':
            if (!this.player.guardFavors) {
                this.player.guardFavors = {};
            }
            this.player.guardFavors.ignoreViolation = true;
            this.showMessage('Guard will ignore your next minor violation.', 3000);
            break;

        case 'cigarettes':
            if (!this.player.inventory) {
                this.player.inventory = {};
            }
            this.player.inventory.cigarettes = (this.player.inventory.cigarettes || 0) + 20;
            this.player.cigarettes = (this.player.cigarettes || 0) + 20;
            this.showMessage('Received 20 cigarettes! Guard looked the other way.', 3000);
            break;

        case 'contraband':
            const contrabandItems = ['phone', 'screwdriver', 'magazine', 'chocolate', 'map'];
            const randomItem = contrabandItems[Math.floor(Math.random() * contrabandItems.length)];
            if (!this.player.inventory) {
                this.player.inventory = {};
            }
            this.player.inventory[randomItem] = (this.player.inventory[randomItem] || 0) + 1;
            this.showMessage(`Received contraband: ${randomItem}! Don't get caught.`, 3000);
            break;

        case 'escape':
            // Boost escape success rate
            if (this.player.escapeProgress) {
                Object.keys(this.player.escapeProgress).forEach(route => {
                    if (this.player.escapeProgress[route].progress) {
                        this.player.escapeProgress[route].progress += 15;
                    }
                });
            }
            this.showMessage('Guard looked away during escape prep. +15% success rate!', 3000);
            break;

        case 'reduce':
            this.player.prisonDays = Math.max(0, this.player.prisonDays - 7);
            this.showMessage('Paperwork "adjusted". Sentence reduced by 7 days!', 3000);
            this.updatePrisonUI();
            break;
    }

    // Update display and save
    document.getElementById('favorTokenCount').textContent = this.player.favorTokens;
    document.getElementById('favorTokensDisplay').textContent = this.player.favorTokens;
    this.saveGame();
}

// Update prison UI to show favor tokens
updatePrisonUI() {
    // ... existing code ...

    // Add favor token display
    const favorTokens = this.player.favorTokens || 0;
    if (document.getElementById('favorTokensDisplay')) {
        document.getElementById('favorTokensDisplay').textContent = favorTokens;
    }
}
```

this.player = {
    // ... existing properties ...

    // Guard manicure system
    favorTokens: 0,                    // Number of favor tokens earned
    guardManicures: {},                // Track manicures per guard: {jenkins: 2, martinez: 1, ...}
    guardFavors: {                     // Active favors
        ignoreViolation: false         // One-time violation ignore
    },
    goodBehavior: 100                  // Good behavior score (0-100)

## DARK HUMOR ELEMENTS

### Absurdist Premises
- Guards in dystopian prison are obsessed with manicures
- Inmates judge you for giving guards manicures (but secretly want them too)
- Manicure quality determines prison favors
- Guards have strong opinions about nail polish colors
- Entire system subverts tough prison stereotype

### Ridiculous Dialogue Examples

**Guard Jenkins (during filing):**
"Your filing technique reminds me of someone trying to parallel park. Unacceptable."

**Guard Martinez (if you fail):**
"My grandmother could file better nails than this. She's been dead for 15 years."

**Guard Chen (during drying):**
"If you move your hand, I'm adding 3 years to your sentence. Don't test me."

**Guard Thompson (random chatter):**
"You know, I always wanted to open a nail salon. Then I became a prison guard for a totalitarian driving regime. Life is strange."

**Guard Rodriguez (suspiciously):**
"This is a setup, isn't it? You're going to file my nails and then... what? Escape? Use the nail file as a weapon? I'm onto you."

### Inmate Reactions
- Cellmate: "You're giving guards MANICURES? That's... actually genius. Can you teach me?"
- Gang members: "Word is you're the manicure guy. Weird hustle, but it works."
- Other inmates: "I saw you with Guard Chen yesterday. His nails looked great. I'm jealous."

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Initialization
Call `initializeManicureSystem()` in your game constructor or init method:
```javascript
constructor() {
    // ... existing code ...
    this.initializeManicureSystem();
}
```

### Save/Load Support
The system automatically saves:
- Favor token count
- Manicures per guard
- Active favor buffs

Ensure your saveGame/loadGame methods include:
```javascript
favorTokens: this.player.favorTokens || 0,
guardManicures: this.player.guardManicures || {},
guardFavors: this.player.guardFavors || {}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Timer intervals cleared on step completion
- Event listeners removed after use
- Canvas operations optimized
- No persistent animations

- `game.js` - Needs integration methods added (see Integration section above)

### Total Lines Added
- JavaScript: ~500 lines
- HTML: ~200 lines
- CSS: ~30 lines
- Documentation: This file

---

## INTEGRATION STEPS

1. **Verify Files Created:**
   - Confirm `guard-manicure.js` exists in game/ directory
   - Confirm script tag added to index.html

2. **Add Integration Methods to game.js:**
   - Copy the integration code from this document
   - Add to your main game class
   - Initialize system in constructor

3. **Test Basic Flow:**
   - Start game
   - Go to prison
   - Click "GIVE MANICURE TO GUARD"
   - Complete mini-game
   - Verify favor token awarded

4. **Test Favor Spending:**
   - Accumulate tokens (or debug add them)
   - Visit "SPEND GUARD FAVORS" menu
   - Purchase favors
   - Verify effects applied

5. **Save/Load Testing:**
   - Earn favor tokens
   - Save game
   - Reload page
   - Load game
   - Verify tokens preserved

---

## SUPPORT AND TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**"game.manicureSystem is undefined"**
- Ensure `initializeManicureSystem()` is called
- Check script load order in index.html
- Verify guard-manicure.js file exists

**Mini-games not responding**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify onclick handlers in HTML match method names
- Ensure canvas elements have correct IDs

**Favor tokens not saving**
- Check player object includes favorTokens property
- Verify saveGame() includes manicure properties
- Test localStorage availability

**Guards always the same**
- Random selection uses Math.random()
- Check if guard selection is cached
- Verify Object.keys() working on guards object

---

## CONCLUSION

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready guard manicure bribe system with:
- 5 unique mini-games
- 5 distinct guard personalities
- Dark humor dialogue
- Token economy system
- Full integration with existing prison mechanics

The system is self-contained, well-documented, and ready for immediate use in VROOM VROOM.
