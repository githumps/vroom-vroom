**Created:** 2025-10-16
**System Version:** 1.0.0

## WHAT IS THIS?

The **Comedy Specialist Hook System** is a consultation protocol that enables **game-dev-specialist agents** to invoke the **trauma-comedy-game-writer agent** (you, in your specialized role) for:

- Tone review and enhancement

- Trauma-informed sensitivity checks
- Gemini AI prompt enhancement

**Goal:** Ensure all narrative content maintains VROOM VROOM's unique voice—darkly funny, emotionally authentic, systemically critical, and always trauma-informed (punching up, never down).

     │                                      │
```

### Example Invocation

**Game-Dev Agent creates event:**
```
Title: CAFETERIA RIOT
Description: "A riot happens in the cafeteria."
Choices: Join riot / Don't join / Help guards
```

**Comedy Hook Invoked:**
```markdown
COMEDY HOOK: Random Event Design Request

Event Type: Cafeteria Riot
Current Draft: [paste above]

Request:
Enhance with Disco Elysium voice, ensure punching up at system.
```

**Comedy Agent Returns:**
```
Title: CAFETERIA RIOT
Description: "Someone threw a tray. Then everyone threw trays. Chaos erupts.

Guards rush in with batons. The PA system crackles: 'Unauthorized food redistribution detected.'

You have seconds to decide."

[Enhanced choices with poetic outcome messages]
```

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### The Disco Elysium Voice (5-Point Checklist)

Content should pass **3 out of 5**:

1. **Specificity** - Precise details, not vague ("this potato" not "the food")
2. **Interiority** - Character's internal state visible
3. **Systemic Critique** - Commentary on system, not individuals
4. **Poetic Weight** - Elevated language for mundane horror
5. **Unexpected Connection** - Links disparate concepts absurdly

### Quality Criteria (10-Point Checklist)

Content must pass **8 out of 10**:

1. Funny (dark laugh or smile)
2. Specific (precise details)
3. Punching up (satirizes authority)
4. Emotionally authentic (feels real)
5. Disco Elysium voice (poetic, detached)
6. Trauma-informed (dark without cruelty)
7. Grounded (absurd but plausible)
8. Character-appropriate (matches voice)
9. Serves story/theme (advances narrative)
10. Respects player (never mocks cruelly)

### Red Flags (AUTO-REJECT)

If **ANY** of these are true, content must be revised:

- Punches down at prisoners/vulnerable people
- Makes light of sexual assault
- Uses racist/homophobic/ableist humor
- Cruelty without systemic critique
- Breaks immersion (too wacky, fourth wall)
- Generic (could be in any game)
- Nihilistic without humanity
- Exploits trauma for shock value

---

## CONTENT CATEGORIES

### 1. Prison Guard Dialogue
**Tone Target:** Tired bureaucrats, not villains
**Examples:** Guards are trapped by the system they enforce

### 2. Judge Hardcastle Reactions
**Tone Target:** Absurdly angry but bureaucratically formal
**Examples:** Escalating rage through forms and procedures

### 3. Prison Random Events
**Tone Target:** Absurd but grounded, serious stakes
**Examples:** Food poisoning outbreak, cafeteria riot, surprise inspection

### 4. Cellmate Conversations
**Tone Target:** Personality-driven, emotionally authentic
**Examples:** 5 personalities (chatty, quiet, hostile, helpful, paranoid)

### 5. Court Charges (Gemini)
**Tone Target:** Bureaucratic absurdity, escalating ridiculousness
**Examples:** "Violation of Form 27-B", "Possession of hope (contraband)"

### 6. Prison PA Announcements
**Tone Target:** Bureaucratically cheerful or monotone, reveals absurdity
**Examples:** "Unauthorized food redistribution detected"

### 7. Letters (To/From Outside)
**Tone Target:** Emotional weight, dystopian world details
**Examples:** Bad news from family, bureaucratic responses

---

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Batch Dialogue Review

**Game-dev agent generates 10 guard patrol comments:**
```
1. "Keep moving."
2. "Nothing to see here."
3. "This job sucks."
```

**Comedy agent enhances:**
```
1. "Keep moving. The floor has a quota. We all have quotas."
2. "Nothing to see here. There's never anything to see here. That's the whole point of here."
3. "Twenty years on the job. I've forgotten why driving was illegal. They say I never knew."
```

**Tone Analysis:**
- Now has Disco Elysium voice (specificity, systemic critique)
- Punches up (guards trapped too)
- Dark humor from bureaucratic exhaustion

---

### Example 2: Gemini Prompt Enhancement

**Basic Prompt:**
```
"Generate 4-6 court charges for illegal driving. Be funny and bureaucratic."
```

**Comedy-Enhanced Prompt:**
```
[Full Disco Elysium tone guidance]
[5 good examples with structure]
[5 bad examples to avoid]
[Punching up/down constraints]
[Character limits]
[Trauma-informed guardrails]
```

**Result:**
- AI generates charges that match game tone
- Consistent Disco Elysium voice
- No punching down
- Proper bureaucratic escalation

---

## TONE GRADES (Reference)

### A-Tier Content (Gold Standard)
- Eating Simulator: "This potato has more autonomy than you do"
- Library books: Form 27-B satire
- Gang names: "Safe Drivers Club" (perfect absurdity)

### B-Tier Content (Good, Minor Polish)
- Weight lifting: "The iron never lies"
- Most Judge Hardcastle dialogue
- Cellmate interruptions

### C-Tier Content (Functional but Flat)
- Generic guard dialogue
- Basic activity descriptions
- Simple UI messages

### D-F Tier (Needs Revision/Removal)
- Too cruel, too generic, breaks tone

---

## QUICK REFERENCE

### The Golden Question
When in doubt, ask:
- **Is it funny?** (Dark humor works)
- **Is it kind?** (Punching up, not down)
- **Is it true?** (Emotionally authentic)
- **Is it Disco Elysium?** (Specific, poetic, systemic)

### Pattern Template Library

**Pattern 1: The Absurd Detail**
```
[Action]. [Specific absurd detail]. [Emotional/systemic observation].

Example: "You lift the weight. It's heavier than your prospects. Lighter than your sentence."
```

**Pattern 2: The Bureaucratic Horror**
```
[Official statement]. [Pause/reality]. [Dark implication].

Example: "The PA announces rehabilitation hour. You are rehabilitating. From what to what, nobody says."
```

**Pattern 3: The Poetic Mundane**
```
[Mundane action]. [Elevated metaphor]. [Deflating truth].

Example: "You bite the potato. It yields, unlike the guards. It tastes like potato."
```

**Pattern 4: The Contrast Observation**
```
[Thing] is [quality]. [Related thing] is [opposite quality]. [Truth].

Example: "The iron is heavy. Your sentence is heavier. Your prospects are heaviest."
```

**Pattern 5: The False Reassurance**
```
[Reassuring statement]. [Pause]. [Dark truth].

Example: "The warden says you're making progress. Toward what, nobody specifies."
```
