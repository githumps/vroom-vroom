## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**"Gemini API not working"**
- Check API key in sessionStorage
- Verify Gemini API enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check console for error messages
- Test with static fallback mode (no API key)

**"Judge animations choppy"**
- Check frame rate (should be 8-12 FPS for Ace Attorney style)
- Reduce animation complexity if needed
- Test on different devices
- Consider disabling some effects on mobile

**"Corruption not updating"**
- Verify event integration (bribes, contraband, gangs)
- Check player object has `corruption` property
- Test with console: `game.player.corruption`
- Verify save/load persistence

**"Comedy feels off-tone"**
- Use COMEDY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md 4 Golden Questions
- Check if content passes 8/10 quality criteria
- Verify no red flags triggered
- Invoke comedy specialist for review
- Study Eating Simulator examples (gold standard)
