# COMEDY HOOK - QUICK REFERENCE CARD
## Rapid Tone Check for VROOM VROOM Content

**Print this. Keep it visible. Use it constantly.**

---

## THE 4 GOLDEN QUESTIONS

Before approving ANY player-facing content, ask:

1. **Is it funny?** → Dark humor that makes you smile sadly
2. **Is it kind?** → Punches UP (at system), not DOWN (at people)
3. **Is it true?** → Emotionally authentic, not just shocking
4. **Is it Disco Elysium?** → Specific, poetic, systemically critical

**All 4 = YES?** Content approved.
**Any 1 = NO?** Revise or reject.

---

## THE 5-SECOND TONE TEST

Read the content aloud. Does it sound like:

✅ **GOOD:** "This potato has more autonomy than you do."
- Specific (this potato)
- Poetic (autonomy metaphor)
- Systemic critique (prisoner has no freedom)
- Dark but not cruel

❌ **BAD:** "The food is terrible."
- Vague (what food?)
- No poetry
- States obvious
- Boring

---

## DISCO ELYSIUM VOICE CHECKLIST

**Content must pass 3 of 5:**

1. **Specificity** → "This potato" not "the food"
2. **Interiority** → Character's thoughts visible
3. **Systemic Critique** → Blames system, not person
4. **Poetic Weight** → Elevated language for mundane
5. **Unexpected Connection** → Freedom = potato autonomy

---

## RED FLAGS (INSTANT REJECT)

If **ANY** of these are true, **REJECT IMMEDIATELY:**

❌ Punches down (mocks prisoners for being imprisoned)
❌ Sexual assault jokes (NEVER acceptable)
❌ Racist/homophobic/ableist (not funny, just harmful)
❌ Cruelty without critique (mean for mean's sake)
❌ Too wacky (breaks immersion, cartoon violence)
❌ Generic (could be in any prison game)

---

## PUNCHING UP vs DOWN

### ✅ PUNCHING UP (GOOD)
- Mock the **system** (bureaucracy, forms, absurd laws)
- Satirize **authority** (guards, judge, warden, government)
- Expose **hypocrisy** (driving illegal = 10 years, no rehab)
- Highlight **contradictions** (making license plates in prison)

**Example:** "The warden announces a new policy: Make license plates for cars you can't drive. The irony is not lost on you."

### ❌ PUNCHING DOWN (BAD)
- Mock **prisoners** for their situation
- Laugh at **vulnerability**
- Make **victims** the joke
- Cruelty toward **powerless**

**Example:** "Your cellmate is so dumb he thinks he'll get out. What an idiot." ← NEVER DO THIS

- "You eat food."
- "The judge is angry."

### ✅ ENHANCED (Approve)
- "Guard walks by. Keys jangle. The sound of authority passing judgment on your existence. Then: silence."
- "This potato has more autonomy than you do. You eat it anyway. Slowly. What else is there to do?"
- "Judge's patience has expired. Like milk. Like hope. Like your freedom. He strikes the gavel."

## EMERGENCY TONE FIX

**Playtester says content is problematic:**

1. **Identify issue:**
   - Punching down? → Rewrite to punch up
   - Too cruel? → Add humanity/empathy
   - Generic? → Add specificity + Disco voice
   - Breaks tone? → Review A-tier examples

2. **Apply pattern:**
   - Use one of 5 pattern templates
   - Add Disco voice (3/5 checklist)
   - Ensure punching up
   - Test with 4 golden questions

3. **Validate:**
   - Read aloud
   - Compare to Eating Simulator
   - Check 8/10 quality criteria
   - Get second opinion

---

## GOLD STANDARD REFERENCE

**EATING SIMULATOR** is the perfect tone. Study it.

Examples:
- "This potato has more autonomy than you do."
- "The spoon is heavier than your freedom was."
- "You wonder if they season it with despair."
- "Bite 12. You've lost count before. You'll lose count again."
- "The potato yields. Unlike the judge. Unlike time."

**What makes it perfect:**
- Specific ("this potato", "the spoon", "bite 12")
- Poetic (autonomy, freedom, despair metaphors)
- Systemic critique (compares mundane to oppression)
- Dark but not cruel (sad-funny, not mean)
- Grounded (actually eating, actually oppressed)

**Use this as your north star.**
