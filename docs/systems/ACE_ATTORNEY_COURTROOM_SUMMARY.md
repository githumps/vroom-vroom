## WHY THIS MATTERS

### Current Problem
The courtroom is **text-based and flat**. Player mistakes don't have **visceral impact**. Judge Hardcastle's personality is buried in dialogue, not **visually expressed**.

### Solution
Make the player **FEEL** Judge Hardcastle's escalating fury:
- See his face redden
- Watch veins pulse
- Feel the screen shake
- Hear the gavel shatter
- Experience the dread

### Result
The courtroom becomes **memorable, intimidating, and hilarious** - a perfect match for VROOM VROOM's absurdist dystopian tone.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review** complete system design in `ACE_ATTORNEY_COURTROOM_SYSTEM.md`
2. **Follow** integration guide in `ACE_ATTORNEY_COURTROOM_INTEGRATION.md`
3. **Implement** in phases (File Setup â†’ Renderer â†’ Animator â†’ Integration)
4. **Test** thoroughly (all states, all platforms)
5. **Deploy** as centerpiece of v1.5.0
