## DARK HUMOR ELEMENTS

### Absurdist Concepts
- Guards in totalitarian prison obsessed with nail care
- Manicure quality determines bribe effectiveness
- Guards critique technique like art critics
- Other inmates judge but secretly want manicures
- Complete subversion of tough prison stereotype

### Example Dialogue

**Guard Chen (impatient):**
"Every second you waste filing, I'm thinking of new violations to write you up for."

**Guard Thompson (chatty):**
"Between you and me, I think the driving laws are excessive. Don't tell anyone. Now about this cuticle..."

**Guard Rodriguez (paranoid):**
"Why are you being nice? What's your angle? You're planning something with these manicures!"

**Guard Martinez (perfectionist):**
"My grandmother could file better nails. She's been dead for 15 years."

**Guard Jenkins (strict):**
"Red reminds me of stop signs. I miss enforcing traffic laws. STOP. TIMER. NOW."
