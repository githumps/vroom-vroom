## üéÆ INTEGRATION GUIDE

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Import assets
import CarSprites from './car-sprites.js';
import EnvironmentTiles from './environment-tiles.js';
import CharacterSprites from './character-sprites.js';
import AtmosphericEffects from './effects.js';

// Render car
const beater = CarSprites.cars.beater;
const beaterColor = CarSprites.colorVariations.beater[0]; // burgundy

// Apply color and render
const renderedCar = CarSprites.rendering.applyColor(
    beater.idle.pixelData[0],
    beaterColor
);

// Add wear
CarSprites.rendering.applyWear(renderedCar, beater.wear);

// Render to canvas
context.drawImage(renderedCar, x, y);
```

### Particle System

```javascript
// Initialize particle system
AtmosphericEffects.particleSystem.initialize();

// Spawn dust when car moves
if (carSpeed > 0) {
    AtmosphericEffects.particleSystem.spawn(
        'dust.kicked_up',
        { x: carX - 20, y: carY + 40 },
        { speed: carSpeed }
    );
}

// Update and render
function gameLoop(deltaTime) {
    AtmosphericEffects.particleSystem.update(deltaTime);
    AtmosphericEffects.particleSystem.render(context, camera);
}
```

### Time-of-Day Lighting

```javascript
// Set time of day
const currentTime = 'evening'; // morning/noon/afternoon/evening/night

// Apply lighting
const lighting = EnvironmentTiles.lighting[currentTime];
skyColor = lighting.sky_color;
ambientColor = lighting.ambient;
lampState = lighting.lamp_state; // on/off

// Update street lamps
EnvironmentTiles.furniture.lamppost.states[lampState];
```

## üéØ STYLE GUIDELINES

### Pixel Art Rules
1. **No anti-aliasing** - Crisp, sharp pixels only
2. **Limited palette** - Muted, desaturated Disco Elysium colors
3. **Consistent shading** - 3-level shading (highlight, mid, shadow)
4. **Isometric consistency** - All assets use 2:1 projection
5. **Atmospheric** - Vibey, moody, oppressive dystopian feel

### Color Philosophy
- **Muted, never vibrant** - Desaturated tones
- **Bureaucratic gray** - Concrete, asphalt dominance
- **Rust and decay** - Wear shows history
- **Pollution haze** - Atmosphere reduces contrast
- **No pure black/white** - Always slightly tinted

### Animation Philosophy
- **Economy of frames** - 2-4 frames for most animations
- **8 fps target** - Retro pixel art feel
- **Subtle motion** - Breathing, swaying, not frantic
- **Atmospheric** - Effects enhance mood, not distract

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### To Complete Integration:

1. **Create Renderer Class**
   - Canvas-based isometric renderer
   - Sprite sheet generator
   - Layer management (parallax)

2. **Implement Color System**
   - Palette swapping function
   - Shader-like color replacement
   - Dynamic recoloring

3. **Animation Controller**
   - Frame sequencing
   - Timing management
   - State transitions

4. **Particle Manager**
   - Object pooling
   - Update/render loop
   - Culling system

5. **Replace Three.js Scene**
   - Swap 3D driving with 2D sidescroller
   - Maintain game logic
   - Add parallax scrolling

## üé® ARTISTIC VISION

**Disco Elysium meets pixel art driving game**

### Mood
- Oppressive yet beautiful
- Bureaucratic dystopia
- Worn and decaying
- Atmospheric and vibey
- Darkly humorous

### Influences
- Disco Elysium (color palette, mood)
- Stardew Valley (pixel art warmth)
- Hyper Light Drifter (atmosphere)
- Papers Please (bureaucratic aesthetic)

### Visual Identity
Every pixel tells a story of a world where driving is illegal, cars are rusted relics, and the city crumbles under bureaucratic weight. The art is beautiful in its decay, vibey in its oppression, and absolutely gorgeous in its muted melancholy.
