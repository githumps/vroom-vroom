## DIALOGUE FLAVOR EXAMPLES

### Safe Drivers Club

**FOREMAN (Leader):**
- "Section 3.2.1 of the Driver's Manual clearly states: 'Signal before merging.' Do you comply?"
- "Your reckless acceleration violates seventeen safety protocols. We can teach you better."
- "In this prison, as on the road, following the rules keeps you alive."

**YIELD (Enforcer):**
- "Slow down. Think. Signal. In that order."
- "I drove trucks for twenty years. Never once broke the speed limit. Look where it got me."
- "You want trouble? I'll give you a full stop."

**ROOKIE (Prospect):**
- "Oh wow, are you joining? FOREMAN's teachings changed my life!"
- "Did you know the optimal following distance is three seconds? Four in rain!"
- "I'm on probation, but soon I'll get my official whistle!"

### Turn Signals Faction

**INDICATOR (Leader):**
- "Communication prevents collision. Always signal your intent."
- "The prison operates on cycles, like traffic lights. Learn the patterns."
- "My algorithm predicts your next move. You're more predictable than you think."

**HAZARD (Enforcer):**
- "Alpha Tango. Incoming. Stand by."
- "All clear. Proceed with caution. Over."
- "Negative. That sector is red. Recommend alternate route. Copy?"

**BLINKER (Prospect):**
- "I modded my toothbrush into a signal beacon! Want to see?"
- "INDICATOR said I have 'potential,' which is basically the highest compliment ever!"
- "These LEDs flash at exactly 1.5 Hz, which is the legal standard for turn signals!"

### Road Warriors

**REDLINE (Leader):**
- "Life's a race. Prison's just a pit stop."
- "They locked us up for driving. Joke's on them – we're faster than ever."

**BURNOUT (Enforcer):**
- "Talk. Fast."
- "Smash. Or get smashed."
- "Derby taught me: last car standing wins."

**NITRO (Prospect):**
