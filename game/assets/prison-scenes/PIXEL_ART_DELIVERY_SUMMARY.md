## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Scene Display

```javascript
// Show gym screen
game.showScreen('prisonGym');
// Gym scene auto-renders via PrisonSceneRenderer

// Player clicks punching bag
// → sceneInteraction event fires
// → handleSceneInteraction('gym', {action: 'punchBag'})
// → game.punchBag() called
```

### Adding Atmosphere

```javascript
// Synchronize yard lighting with game time
const gameHour = this.gameTime.hours;
let timeOfDay = 'noon';

if (gameHour >= 5 && gameHour < 8) timeOfDay = 'morning';
else if (gameHour >= 8 && gameHour < 16) timeOfDay = 'noon';
else if (gameHour >= 16 && gameHour < 19) timeOfDay = 'afternoon';
else if (gameHour >= 19 && gameHour < 22) timeOfDay = 'evening';
else timeOfDay = 'night';

this.sceneRenderers.yard.setTimeOfDay(timeOfDay);
```

### Character Interaction

```javascript
// Add gang members to yard when player visits
if (this.player.currentGang === 'roadWarriors') {
    const leader = CharacterSprites.inmates.archetypes.find(a => a.id === 'gang_leader');
    this.sceneRenderers.yard.addCharacter(leader, {x: 250, y: 520});
}
```

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Disco Elysium Aesthetic

**Key Principles:**
1. Muted, painterly color palettes
2. Atmospheric lighting (not bright)
3. Environmental storytelling (graffiti, wear, stains)
4. Dark humor details (menu boards, posters)
5. Contrast between harsh reality and small comforts

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. Characters stand out (prison orange vs muted backgrounds)
2. Interactive elements slightly highlighted
3. Atmosphere supports mood (not distracting)
4. Details reward close inspection

### Pixel Art Economy

**Efficiency:**
- 8 fps animations (not 60fps)
- Simple walk cycles (8 frames max)
- Reusable templates with variations
- Procedural generation where possible
- Smart caching for static elements

**Readability:**
- Clear silhouettes at 32x48 pixels
- High contrast for important elements
- Distinct character archetypes
- Obvious interactive hotspots
