- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework bloat
- **CSS3** - Matrix/terminal aesthetic
- **LocalStorage API** - Save/load functionality

## GAME FLOW

1. **Main Menu** → Character Creation
2. **Character Creation** → Customize appearance and voice
3. **Driving Mode** → Drive until police catch you (inevitable)
4. **Courtroom** → Fill out bureaucratic paperwork
5. **Prison** → Serve time through various activities
6. **Liberation** → Credits roll
7. **Repeat** → Save/load allows replay

## CONTROLS

### Driving Mode
- **W / Arrow Up**: Accelerate
- **A / Arrow Left**: Turn left
- **D / Arrow Right**: Turn right
- **SPACE**: Pull over voluntarily (why would you?)

### UI Navigation
- **Mouse**: Click buttons
- **Form Fields**: Type to fill paperwork

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS (ACCEPTABLE FOR LAUNCH)

- Police car physics are intentionally simple (they always catch you)
- 3D models are primitive geometric shapes (aesthetic choice)
- No sound effects (silence enhances the dread)
- Prison sentence can be skipped with button (for testing)
- Single city environment (over-policing is everywhere)

## PERFORMANCE

- Runs at 60fps on modern browsers
- Minimal memory footprint
- No external dependencies except Three.js CDN
- Works offline after initial CDN load

## BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

Tested and working:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 90+
- Safari 14+ (may need local server)

## WHAT MAKES THIS GAME WORK

1. **Complete Gameplay Loop**: Drive → Caught → Paperwork → Prison → End
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Character customization affects nothing (just like real life)
3. **Progression System**: Prison activities advance time
4. **Multiple Endings**: All end the same way (you go to prison)
5. **Save System**: Players can return to their punishment
6. **Comedy**: Absurdist humor throughout
