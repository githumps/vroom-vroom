## AI LOGIC SPECIFICATION (MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED)

### Event Graph Logic Overview:

Due to Unreal Engine Python API limitations, Event Graph nodes cannot be created programmatically. The following logic must be manually implemented in the Blueprint Event Graph.

### 1. Variables to Create (4 total):

| Variable Name     | Type                | Default Value | Editable | Purpose                          |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| PlayerReference   | Actor (Reference)   | None          | FALSE    | Store reference to player        |
| bIsChasing        | Boolean             | FALSE         | FALSE    | Track chase state                |
| DetectionRange    | Float               | 3000.0        | TRUE     | Detection radius                 |
| AggressionChance  | Float               | 0.95          | TRUE     | 95% chance to be aggressive      |

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL CREATION

---

### 2. Event BeginPlay Logic:

**Purpose:** Initialize detection timer and aggression check

**Node Chain:**
```
Event BeginPlay
→ Set Timer by Function Name
  - Function Name: "DetectPlayer"
  - Time: 0.5 seconds
  - Looping: TRUE
→ Random Float in Range (0.0 - 1.0)
→ Branch (Random < 0.95)
  - TRUE: Print "POLICE ACTIVATED - AGGRESSION MODE ENGAGED"
```

**Result:** Police check for player every 0.5 seconds, 95% chance to be aggressive.

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

### 3. DetectPlayer Function:

**Purpose:** Find player and initiate chase

**Node Chain:**
```
Entry
→ Get All Actors of Class (BP_VroomCharacter)
→ ForEach Loop
  → Get Distance Between (Self, Player)
  → Branch (Distance < 3000)
    - TRUE:
      → Set PlayerReference
      → Set bIsChasing = TRUE
      → Print "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"
→ Return
```

**Result:** Police detect player within 3000 units and lock onto them.

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

### 4. Event Tick (Chase Logic):

**Purpose:** Move police toward player every frame

**Method A - AI Move To (Recommended):**
```
Event Tick
→ Branch (bIsChasing == TRUE)
  - TRUE:
    → Is Valid (PlayerReference)
    → AI Move To Actor
      - Goal: PlayerReference
      - Acceptance Radius: 200
      - Use Pathfinding: FALSE
```

**Method B - Manual Movement (More Aggressive):**
```
Event Tick
→ Branch (bIsChasing == TRUE)
  - TRUE:
    → Find Look at Rotation (Self → Player)
    → Set Actor Rotation
    → Get Forward Vector
    → Add Movement Input (Scale: 1.0 = FULL THROTTLE)
```

**Result:** Police chase player continuously at full speed.

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

### 5. Arrest Trigger Overlap Event:

**Purpose:** Arrest player on contact

**Node Chain:**
```
OnComponentBeginOverlap (ArrestTrigger)
→ Cast to BP_VroomCharacter
→ Set bIsChasing = FALSE
→ Stop Movement
→ Print "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR: EXISTING"
→ Delay (2.0 seconds)
→ Open Level (by Name: "Courtroom")
```

**Result:** Player is arrested on contact, level transitions to Courtroom.

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL IMPLEMENTATION

---

---

## ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLIFIED 5-MINUTE VERSION

If time is critical, a simplified MVP version can be implemented in 5 minutes:

### Minimal Variables:
- PlayerReference (Actor)
- bIsChasing (Boolean)

### Minimal Event Graph:

**Event BeginPlay:**
```
Event BeginPlay → Get Player Character → Set PlayerReference
```

**Event Tick:**
```
Event Tick → AI Move To Actor (Goal: PlayerReference, Radius: 200)
```

**Arrest Trigger:**
```
OnComponentBeginOverlap → Print "ARRESTED" → Open Level "Courtroom"
```

**Result:** Police chase player from spawn, arrest on contact.
**Aggression:** 100% (no random chance, always aggressive)
**Time:** 5 minutes

This version provides immediate chase behavior with maximum aggression.

---

## LIMITATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS

### Unreal Engine Python API Limitations:

1. **Event Graph:** Python cannot create Event Graph nodes
   - Reason: Blueprint visual scripting API is read-only in Python
   - Solution: Manual implementation required

2. **Component Events:** Python cannot bind component events
   - Reason: Event binding not exposed to Python API
   - Solution: Must add overlap events manually in editor

3. **Material Instances:** Python has limited material control
   - Reason: Dynamic material instance creation is restricted
   - Solution: Basic material assigned, color can be adjusted in editor

4. **Blueprint Compilation:** Python cannot trigger full recompilation
   - Reason: Compilation is editor-only operation
   - Solution: Blueprint must be opened and compiled manually

### Workarounds Implemented:

1. **Component Automation:** Fully automated via Python
2. **Detailed Documentation:** Step-by-step manual instructions provided
3. **Quick Reference:** ASCII diagrams for fast implementation
4. **Simplified Version:** 5-minute MVP for time-critical scenarios

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (Required):

1. **Run Python Script:**
   - Open Unreal Engine Editor
   - Tools > Execute Python Script
   - Execute: configure_police_ai.py
   - Verify components added (check Output Log)

2. **Manual Event Graph Setup:**
   - Open BP_PoliceVehicle
   - Follow AGENT5_POLICE_AI_MANUAL_SETUP.md

3. **Testing:**
   - Place BP_PoliceVehicle in OpenWorld level
   - PIE (Play In Editor)
   - Verify chase behavior
   - Verify arrest functionality
   - Check Output Log for errors

### Optional Enhancements:

4. **Visual Polish:**
   - Adjust mesh scale/color in editor
   - Add siren rotation animation
   - Add particle effects

5. **Audio:**
   - Add siren sound to PoliceLight
   - Add engine sound on chase
   - Add arrest sound effect

6. **Advanced AI:**
   - Add random patrol behavior when not chasing
   - Add backup police spawning
   - Add wanted level system

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Issue: Python script fails to find blueprint
**Solution:**
- Verify BP_PoliceVehicle exists at /Game/Blueprints/Vehicles/BP_PoliceVehicle
- Run create_all_blueprints.py first if blueprint doesn't exist

#### Issue: Components not appearing
**Solution:**
- Open BP_PoliceVehicle in editor and check Components tab
- Re-run Python script if components missing
- Check Output Log for errors during script execution

#### Issue: Police not detecting player
**Solution:**
- Verify Set Timer is in Event BeginPlay
- Check Function Name is exactly "DetectPlayer" (case-sensitive)
- Ensure Looping is TRUE
- Verify player class name in "Get All Actors of Class"

#### Issue: Police not chasing
**Solution:**
- Check bIsChasing is set to TRUE in DetectPlayer function
- Verify Event Tick has Branch checking bIsChasing
- Ensure AI Move To Actor is called when Branch is TRUE
- Add Is Valid check before using PlayerReference

#### Issue: Arrest not triggering
**Solution:**
- Verify ArrestTrigger "Generate Overlap Events" = TRUE
- Check OnComponentBeginOverlap event exists for ArrestTrigger
- Verify Cast to player class succeeds (check class name)
- Position ArrestTrigger further forward if needed

#### Issue: Level won't transition
**Solution:**
- Verify level name is exactly "Courtroom" (case-sensitive)
- Check Courtroom.umap exists in Content/Maps/
- Add Courtroom level to Project Settings > Packaging > Maps to Package
