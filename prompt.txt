make a video game that is called vroom vroom and presents itself as a driving simulator, but really, there is a lot more to it than that. the game starts out as a highly detailed open-world driving simulation game like Forza
Horizons, but the universe of the game is HIGHLY policed. The police presence in the game is totally disproportionate to anything remotely realistic. There's SO MANY FREAKING COPS EVERYWHERE. It's annoying and terrible. In the game,
 it's hard as fuck to actually drive in a normal way. You can't do anything illegal other than drive real bad, so it's not like GTA or anything. You can do police chases if you want, but the police are really fast and often catch
you and you get arrested. Anyway, there's a highly detailed cortroom simulation element to the game where you need to secure legal representation and make your free phonecall to the right person (you only have one! you got
arrested!!). So you have to do like actual paperwork and it should be super detailed and tedious cortroom paperwork. It doesn't matter what you fill in as long as you fill in ALLLLLLLLLLLLL of it. After several court appearances in
the hevily policed world, the judge will be irritated with your repeat offenses and you will be sent to prison. Once you're in prison, the game is an EXTREMELY detailed prison simulator. For example, you have to do sets & reps of
prison weight room exercises, you have to eat bad mashed potatoes (one tap at a time), you check out books from the prison library and read them, one page at a time--- they should be real public domain books, so you have to go
through all of the original text inside the game. Your cellmate can distract you or damage your book. You can send letters and you will recieve them from time to time. You can try your luck requesting a conjugal visit. If you get
one, there's a conjugal visit simulator. There are several avenues for getting out of prison: you can try appealing your case, you can work on a transfer to a lower security prison, you can stage an escape either alone or with other
 prisoners. There are same sex romance stories that develop in the prison (think, orange is the new black). You can whittle a toothbrush down real sharp like a shank, and you can do stuff like cut pretty girls out of magazines, and
buy things at the commissary, such as cigarettes or portable personal radios. You can use cigarettes and other favors of many kinds as currency in the prison to influence lines of power. You can network and ally and decide gangs you
 will ally with or make enemies wiht. Be careful! Your cellmate is in some gangs himself! You can give AND get prison tattoos, including creating your very own designs with a tattoo drawing simulation, including creating the stencil
 and applying the ink yourself over the stencil on your skin. Whater you do you can't erase. If you don't take care of your new tattoo, you can infect your arm, and end up in the prison health center. Sometimes maybe someone brings
you like a cake or soemething like bread or something, and it has like an iron file in it, so, y'know, contraband!!! So that's a fun part. Also, you don't know when they might be reading your letters, so... be careful! If you ever
do get out of prison, you will end up back in the same world with all the cops, and all you can do is drive. The prison sentences though are only for like a few days here and there, BUT --- just like in animal crossing, the time of
day IRL is the time of day in the game, and the game is perfectly matched day for day to real life. So when you get discharged from prison, if you boot up the system that day, that's what's happening. If you boot up the system like
days after you last played, the game will decide what all happened in the span of time between then and now, and you'll get a digest of events to read so you understand how to read the room from the place you're starting from----
for example, maybe you got in a fight!! Uh oh, shouldn't have stopped playing! Or like, maybe you dropped the soap-- oopies. You can actually browse the web on the pr9ison library computer. Like it literally is a web browser in the
game, but it throttles your traffic to dialup speed. You can't do anything in the browser except normally browse the real actual internet. There's no futher interaction between the browser and the game universe. There is a heavy
firewall allow/deny list of categories, so you can sort of get blocked if you try to look at forbidden categories, but---- you can actually try to tamper with the firewall controls if you manage to reverse engineer the login system
to the administrative portal for the firewall. It's an actuall CTF style challenge that you can really do. If you actually hack it, you can then visit ALL kinds of websites. This game should be from the first-person perspective, in
a 3d-world using unreal engine 5. The character should be SUPER SUPER customizable in appearance and voice. The character customization level should be similar to the games Cyberpunk 2077 or Baldur's Gate 3. By the end of this, we
should be able to run the first release of the game on my windows gaming computer with a full launch/save/load menu system, and end credits.
