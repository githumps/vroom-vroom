FUNCTION: ValidateForm
=================================================================
Return Type: Boolean
Description: Checks if ALL form fields are filled correctly

LOGIC FLOW:

STEP 1: Check Text Fields Are Not Empty
---------------------------------------
Get Text (NameField)                → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (MotherMaidenField)        → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (GrandmotherMaidenField)   → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (SSNField)                 → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (BloodTypeField)           → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (ExistingField)            → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (VehicleHistoryField)      → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (EssayField)               → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (ReferencesField)          → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE
Get Text (EmergencyContactField)    → IsEmpty → TRUE  → RETURN FALSE

STEP 2: Validate Essay Word Count (EXACTLY 500 WORDS!)
--------------------------------------------------------
Get Text (EssayField)
  → Convert to String
  → ParseIntoArray (Delimiter = " ")
  → Get Array Length
  → Is NOT EQUAL to 500 → TRUE → RETURN FALSE

STEP 3: Check At Least One Relationship Checkbox
-------------------------------------------------
Get Checked State (RelationshipOwner)      → Is Unchecked → TRUE
AND Get Checked State (RelationshipBorrower)   → Is Unchecked → TRUE
AND Get Checked State (RelationshipThief)      → Is Unchecked → TRUE
AND Get Checked State (RelationshipSpiritual)  → Is Unchecked → TRUE
  → If ALL are unchecked → RETURN FALSE

STEP 4: Check All Legal Checkboxes Are Checked
-----------------------------------------------
Get Checked State (Checkbox47B)      → Is Unchecked → TRUE → RETURN FALSE
Get Checked State (CheckboxGuilty)   → Is Unchecked → TRUE → RETURN FALSE
Get Checked State (CheckboxWaiver)   → Is Unchecked → TRUE → RETURN FALSE
Get Checked State (CheckboxSoul)     → Is Unchecked → TRUE → RETURN FALSE

STEP 5: All Validation Passed
------------------------------
RETURN TRUE

=================================================================
FUNCTION: ClearAllFields
=================================================================

=================================================================
FINAL NOTES:
=================================================================

The key to making this hilariously frustrating is the ClearAllFields
function. When the player spends 10 minutes filling out this absurd
form, carefully typing their 500-word essay, checking all the boxes,
and then realizes they missed ONE field... EVERYTHING GETS WIPED.

This is bureaucratic evil at its finest. The player will laugh, curse,
and then fill it out again because they NEED to see what happens when
they complete it.

The sentence that appears after completion is the payoff:
"You are hereby sentenced to 15 years of bureaucratic paperwork.
Your driving privileges have been revoked indefinitely.
Thank you for your compliance."

Perfect comedic irony: They did all that paperwork just to be told
they're sentenced to more paperwork and can't drive anyway.
